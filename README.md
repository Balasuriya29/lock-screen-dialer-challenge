* I learnt a lot from modifying native code to using trigonometry while animating(Yes, I never took notes but I need to workout the math - Thanks to my Trainer for his help)
* So, There are basically two Views,
    
    1. Dialer View
    2. Simplified View

* At most care in supporting most of the devices (Portrait)
## Tech Stack
